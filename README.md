State Populations Proportional Symbol Map

For this lab, I mapped the United States Population Estimates per State using proportional symbols. The data was pulled from the US Census Bureau Populations Estimates in 2019 and then converted into a geoJSON format using GeoJSON.io. Once this conversion was completed, the data was pulled into an HTML file where the rest of the map was coded. The proportional symbols are coded to change size relative to zooming in and out of the map. They also are coded to highlight upon the mouse hovering over a state. 

I didn't have much trouble completing the basic map. However, even after a good deal of time trying to code the extra credit parts I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. I tried to pull code examples (from the chloropleth map provided by a leaflet java tutorial) to adapt the code to my map. I could get a box saying 'hover over a state' but I had trouble completing the interaction. 

Overall, I enjoyed the map. I think the addition of the highlight interaction helps to make the map more interesting for a user. I hope to incorporate an interaction similar to this in my final map.
